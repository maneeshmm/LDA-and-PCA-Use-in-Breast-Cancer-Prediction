# LDA and PCA in Breast Cancer Prediction

## 1. Introduction

Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide, and early detection is crucial for better treatment outcomes. This project applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to improve breast cancer classification. The primary goal is to compare these two dimensionality reduction techniques and assess their effectiveness in breast cancer prediction.

## 2. Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this study contains medical attributes relevant to breast cancer diagnosis. The features include measurements such as mean radius, mean texture, mean perimeter, mean area, and mean smoothness, among others. The target variable is the diagnosis, which indicates whether a tumor is benign or malignant.

The dataset undergoes preprocessing before applying PCA and LDA.

## 3. Data Preprocessing

Handling Missing Values: The dataset was checked for any missing data, and imputation techniques were applied where necessary.

Feature Scaling: Standardization was performed to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model.

Splitting the Data: The dataset was divided into training and testing sets for evaluation.

## 4. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms data into a new coordinate system, where the greatest variance lies on the first principal component, the second greatest variance on the second component, and so on.

Key Steps in PCA:

The covariance matrix was computed to identify correlations between features.

Eigenvalue decomposition was performed to determine the principal components.

The top components were selected based on explained variance.

Feature dimensions were reduced while retaining most of the variance.

Findings from PCA:

A small number of principal components retained most of the variance, reducing the complexity of the dataset.

Computational efficiency was improved while preserving predictive power.

## 5. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

LDA is a supervised dimensionality reduction technique that maximizes the separation between different classes.

Key Steps in LDA:

Within-class and between-class scatter matrices were calculated.

The optimal projection was determined to maximize class separability.

The dataset was reduced to a lower-dimensional space while maintaining high class discrimination.

Findings from LDA:

LDA focused on class separability rather than variance preservation.

It achieved better classification performance compared to PCA in certain cases.

## 6. Comparison of PCA and LDA

PCA is an unsupervised technique that focuses on maximizing variance in the dataset without considering class labels.

LDA is a supervised technique that aims to maximize the separation between classes, making it more suitable for classification tasks.

Feature reduction in PCA is based on variance, whereas feature reduction in LDA is based on class labels.

PCA is commonly used for data compression and noise removal, while LDA is primarily applied in classification problems.

PCA retains most information but does not necessarily enhance class separation, while LDA enhances class discrimination.

## 7. Results & Conclusion

PCA is useful when dealing with high-dimensional data where reducing redundancy is a priority.

LDA is better suited for classification tasks as it maximizes class separation.

The combination of both techniques can further improve machine learning model performance.
